# Custom settings for some PortableApps applications

* ``portable``: Modifies GitPortable $HOME.
* ``ConEmu.xml``: ConEmu settings

Use ``fetch.bat`` to fetch from correct application directories and ``push.bat`` for the opposite, i.e. you'd want to use ``push.bat`` if you just cloned this repo. 

### Note

These batch files do not have any dependencies other than the drive's directory structure.
