# UserConfigPortable

This leverages PortableApps utilities in the Launcher.ini to perform easy file operations. In other words, the legwork is done in ``App/AppInfo/Launcher/UserConfigPortable.ini``

## Usage

* Clone the repository to your PortableApps folder. 
* Build with [PortableApps.com Launcher](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher) -- make sure [NSIS Portable](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/nsis_portable) is installed -- by pointing to ``<path-to-portable-apps>/UserConfigPortable``.

While I could provide a built version in the repo, I believe this method serves as a better example.  

## Features

* Replace InverseSearch drive letter in Sumatra

## Notes

See [http://portableapps.com/node/43806#comment-222013](http://portableapps.com/node/43806#comment-222013) this thread for my thread asking how this works exactly.
