# Portable Windows Environment

This is a backup for the scripts and utilities on my portable hard drive.

## Features:

* Portable Git bash (with ConEmu!) environment
* Sublime Text in PortableApps menu
* Sublime Text works OOB with Miktex and Sumatra
* Nice example of negated .gitconfig
* Nice example of adding Apps to PortableApps menu (environment variables are also kept!)
* Nice example of leveraging PortableApps file-replacement utilities with Launcher, but no real app. 
* Does not require modifying PortableApps configs by hand -- scripts are provided (see ``portable_apps_settings``). 

## TODO
Explain Usage
Add links (file) in features.
Use subtrees? Especially for UserConfigPortable.
Document hotkeys (AHK)
Might not want to leave .git in drive root (always as if you're in a git repo otherwise). Delete for now. Write script to init, commit, push, delete.
